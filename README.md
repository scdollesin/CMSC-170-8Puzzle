## How To Run
1. Configure the input file `puzzle.in`. Follow the format of the pre-existing contents where there are 3 numbers in each of the three lines separated by spaces
2. Open `Main.java` and replace the path for the `puzzle.in` file since it uses the absolute path to it.
3. Make sure that the `JavaFX` library is installed before running the program.
